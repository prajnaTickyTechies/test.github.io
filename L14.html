                <h5 class="display-5 pb-3 text-center">Paper marbling</h5>
                <p class="lead">
                    Paper marbling is a method of aqueous surface design, which can produce patterns similar
                    to smooth marble or other kinds of stone. The patterns are the result of color floated on
                    either plain water or a viscous solution known as size, and then carefully transferred to 
                    an absorbent surface, such as paper or fabric. Through several centuries, people have 
                    applied marbled materials to a variety of surfaces. It is often employed as a writing 
                    surface for calligraphy, and especially book covers and endpapers in bookbinding and 
                    stationery. Part of its appeal is that each print is a unique monotype.

                <p class="lead text-end">
                    The Bois de Boulogne (French pronunciation: ​[bwɑ d(ə) bulɔɲ], "Boulogne woodland") is a
                    large public park located along the western edge of the 16th arrondissement of Paris, 
                    near the suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt and Neuilly-sur-Seine. The land was ceded to the 
                    city of Paris by the Emperor Napoleon III to be turned into a public park in 1852.
                    It is the second-largest park in Paris, slightly smaller than the Bois de Vincennes on the
                    eastern side of the city. It covers an area of 845 hectares (2088 acres), which is about two
                    and a half times the area of Central Park in New York, slightly less (88%) than that of Richmond 
                    Park in London, and just under half the size of the Phoenix Park in Dublin.

                    <p class="lead">
                        A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in 
                        flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). 
                        The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a 
                        mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of 
                        sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination 
                        or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.
                        The two types of pollination are: self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens
                        when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower 
                        on the same plant. Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to 
                        the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination happens 
                        in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen 
                        can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to 
                        provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.
